A work in progress AmigaOS port of cairo with a native AmigaOS surface backend
and hopefully, eventually also a native font backend.

Currently only a static library is built, but a real shared library (not a
shared object) might be considered once the native backends are reasonably
finished.

For a shared library version of pixman go to:
